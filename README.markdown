STAR BREAK
==========

Star Break is a html5 acrade 'ball and paddle' game written in coffee-script.

It features  levels full of explosives, extra balls and even nukes. 
I hope you will enjoy it.

*If you like this game, you will probably also like my other game JS WARS*

A little bit of history
-----------------------
Star Break started out as coffee-break - a little project
I started to get into coffee script. Because it turned out
to be a lot of fun I decided to turn it into a complete game.
Star Break was born.

Supported browsers
------------------
 * Firefox 4 (3.6 kind of works)
 * Chrome 9
 * Safari (no ogg - no audio)

...Opera doesn't seem to like audio and crashes.

Audio is generally a bit buggy - and I tried hard to get it just that
good. :(

Technology and tools used
-------------------------
Star Break uses the canvas tag for rendering. The sound effects
were created using csound and played using the audio tag.
The graphics were made using the gimp.
Rake is used for the asset pipeline.

Assets
------
All the assets in the game are selfmade - that's why they look like
programmer art.

Open points
-----------
The rendering is highly inefficient, I might improve this at some point.
