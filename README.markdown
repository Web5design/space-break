STAR BREAK
==========

Star Break is a htmlgame inspired by breakout. It features 
levels full of explosives, extra balls and even nukes. 
I hope you will enjoy it.

A little bit of history
-----------------------
Star Break started out as coffee-break - a little project
I started to get into coffee script. Because it turned out
to be a lot of fun I decided to turn it into a complete game.
Star Break was born.
